# 📚 Book Scraper — Readings.com Book Extractor with Search & Sort

**Book Scraper** is a Python + PyQt5 application that automatically scrapes book data from [Readings.com](https://www.readings.com/) and provides a clean, interactive interface for managing the extracted information.

You can specify any **category URL** (e.g., fiction, biography, history, etc.), set a **page limit**, and scrape all book data at once.  
After scraping, you can **load**, **search**, and **sort** the data — including **multi-level sorting** for advanced organization.
